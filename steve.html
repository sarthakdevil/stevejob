 <p class="text-slate-400 py-2">

 <p class="py-7 px-72"><strong class="font-bold">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth writ large:</strong> Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents garage in 1976,
   was ousted in 1985,<br>
   returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997 and by the time he died,
    in October 2011 
    had built it into the world's most<br> valuable company Along the way he helped to transform seven industries 
   personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, <br>
   tablet computing, retail stores, 
   and digital publishing He thus belongs in the pantheon of America's great innovators along with<br> 
   Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney None of these men was a saint,
    but long after their personalities are forgotten, <br>
    history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business</p><br>

       <div style="position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: row;"><p style="position: relative;" class="text-left py-16 left-10 font-semibold text-lg">One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of the book,<br>
          I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people. "Look at the results,<br>" he replied.
           "These are all smart people I work with, and any of them could get a <br 
           >top job at another place if they were
           truly feeling brutalized. 
           But they don't."<br> Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully,<br> 
           "And we got some amazing things done." Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits<br>
            over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in<br> 
            modern times iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad,<br>
             App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness,<br> 
             Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired<br>
          by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children</p>
